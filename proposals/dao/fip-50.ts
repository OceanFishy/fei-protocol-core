Summary:
Shift 100M USD of ETH from Compound and AAVE PCV Deposits to stETH, all TOKE + equivalent ETH to TOKE-ETH Uniswap Pool, all LUSD to the LUSD stability pool, all RAI + equivalent DAI to Uni v3 LP, and burn all FEI in Kashi.

Proposal:
Shift 100M USD of ETH from Compound and AAVE PCV Deposits to stETH, all TOKE + equivalent ETH to TOKE-ETH Uniswap Pool, all LUSD to the LUSD stability pool, all RAI + equivalent DAI to Uni v3 LP, and burn all FEI in Kashi.
The Curve stETH-ETH pair has 5B worth of liquidity. stETH is a highly liquid asset, and appropriate to add to the treasury. Currently the entire recommended stETH allocation can be sold with <0.08% slippage.
The TOKE-ETH pool on Uniswap is a better strategy decision than single-sided TOKE, as it forces pairing with ETH and has a far higher APY of 160%.
Single-sided TOKE is actually at risk as in later Tokemak versions it will be used for TOKE-voted pairings, which are riskier than the TOKE-ETH pairing.
We propose to shift our TOKE rewards as well as an equivalent amount of ETH to TOKE-ETH, and slowly phase out the single sided ETH pool.
Moving 90M LUSD to the stability pool grants 13% APY. The stability pool is extremely safe, and grants a high level of yield to our LUSD funds.
Moving 10M LUSD to Fuse Pool 7 allows us to start an LUSD lending market for Fuse, and this also synergizes well with the upcoming Stability Pool + Fuse Product.
The RAI/DAI Uni v3 LP is incentivized by Reflexer Labs with 48% APY. Due to being a stablecoin pair, there is little to no risk of capital loss. The pool offers a far higher APY than Compound DAI deposits.
Lending deployments on Sushiswapâ€™s Kashi makes less than 1.5k per year currently, lower than the capital risk of deploying 8m on a third-party smart contract. Burning the FEI on Kashi eliminates this smart contract risk, with little profit lost.
